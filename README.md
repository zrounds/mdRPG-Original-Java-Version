# mdRPG-Original-Java-Version-
Original version of mdRPG, developed for UNC's Maze Day 2013 (hence the acronym, Maze Day RPG). The original version does not have tools to create a story, but instead uses a set of hard-coded objects. Additionally, it features voice acting for all narration and dialogue in the story, as the project was designed and targeted at visually impaired children (as Maze Day itself is an event created for this group). I worked on the project with three other students, who handled the bulk of the script writing and recording. I produced 90% of the project code, primarily excluding the Java tool which another member found and implemented to read our audio files.
